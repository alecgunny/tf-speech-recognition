Jupyter Notebook slideshow overview of solution to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge">Kaggle TensorFlow Speech Recognition Challenge</a>. Leverages a custom recurrent model based off of the model outlined in Baidu's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567">Deep Speech</a> paper. Meant to demonstrate the tips and tricks to most fully utilize TensorFlow on GPUs for DL research.

## Preprocessing
We'll leverage TensorFlow's TFRecord file format to ingest our data during training. Before we can preprocess our data and save it to a record, we need to save it locally. This is most easily done using the Kaggle command line API. Follow the instructions for getting an API key <a href="https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api">here</a>. Once you have it saved somewhere, you can preprocess with
```
$ DATA_DIR=/path/to/data
$ KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR=/path/to/kaggle/json

$ docker build \
  -t $USER/tf-src:preproc \
  --build-arg tag=18.12-py3 \
  --target preproc \
  github.com/alecgunny/tf-speech-recognition

$ docker run \
  --rm \
  -it \
  --name=tf-src-preproc \
  --runtime=nvidia \
  -v $DATA_DIR:/data \
  -v $KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR:/tmp/.kaggle/ \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  $USER/tf-src:preproc
```
This will build the tfrecords dataset inside the container and save it on the host at `$DATA_DIR`.

## Running the slideshow
Once your datasets are prepared, build and launch the jupyter notebook server with
```
$ docker build \
  -t $USER/tf-src \
  --build-arg tag=18.12-py3 \
  github.com/alecgunny/tf-speech-recognition

$ docker run \
  --rm \
  -d \
  --name=tf-src \
  --runtime=nvidia \
  -v $DATA_DIR:/data \
  -v tensorboard:/tmp/model \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  $USER/tf-src
```
You can connect to the notebook at `<your machine's ip>:8888/notebooks/Slideshow.ipynb` (consider putting your browser in full screen before you do. This is F11 on Chrome).

## Monitoring
To monitor the impact of changes in the slideshow code on throughput and accuracy, we can use the `tensorboard` build target in our Dockerfile and then run it with the tensorboard volume we created during the previous `docker run` call mounted into the container (creating a whole new image is probably overkill, but is hopefully illustrative).
```
$ docker build \
  -t $USER/tf-src:tensorboard \
  --build-arg tag=18.12-py3 \
  --target tensorboard \
  github.com/alecgunny/tf-speech-recognition

$ docker run \
  --rm \
  -d \
  --name=tf-src-tensorboard \
  --runtime=nvidia \
  -v tensorboard:/tmp/model \
  -p 6006:6006 \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  $USER/tf-src:tensorboard
```

## Clean up
```
$ docker kill tf-src tf-src-tensorboard
$ docker volume rm tensorboard
```
Note that the test data is not built or preprocessed at the moment. To build it, just uncomment the appropriate line in `preproc/preproc.sh`.
